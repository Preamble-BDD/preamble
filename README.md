# Preamble-TS-Core
An environment neutral JavaScript BDD testing framework written in TypeScript which supports writing test suites in TypeScript. Though still in development, Preamble-TS-Core is currently rock-hard stable and is ready to be used in the browser and from the command-line.

## This is not your father's Preamble
Preamble-TS-Core is a complete rewrite of the old but now it is written in TypeScript. Out with the old and in with the new!

## Versioning
Odd major and minor version numbers are considered in development versions.

## Run your tests in the browser
Download or clone the [Preamble-TS-Standalone](https://github.com/Preamble-BDD/standalone), which includes everything you need to author and run your tests, all wrapped up in one tidy repo.

## Run your tests from the command-line
See [Preamble-TS-Node](https://github.com/Preamble-BDD/node.runner.reporter), which provides instructions for running Preamble from the command-line.

## What about the original Preamble?
 [Preamble](https://github.com/jeffschwartz/preamble)
 is still available for now but is now deprecated in favor of Preamble-TS-Core. Instructions describing the migration path from Preamble to Preamble-TS-Core is in the works and will be posted here once completed.

## Documentation
I swear, it's coming :) and the link will be posted here.

## Want to contribute?
I will gladly entertain GitHub pull requests for integrating Preamble-TS-Core with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) test runner.
