# Preamble-TS
An environment neutral JavaScript BDD testing framework written using TypeScript. Supports writing test suites using TypeScript. While still in development and pre-release, Preamble-TS is currently rock-hard stable and is ready to be used in the browser. Preamble-TS v0.4.0 will be command-line and Node compatible.

## This is not your father's Preamble
Preamble-TS is a complete rewrite of the old but now it is written in TypeScript. Out with the old and in with the new!

## Versioning
Odd major and minor version numbers represent development versions. Even major and minor version numbers represent release versions.

## Run your tests in the browser
Download or clone the [Preamble-TS-Standalone](https://github.com/Preamble-BDD/standalone), which includes everything you need to author and run your tests, all wrapped up in one tidy repo.

## What about the original Preamble?
 [Preamble](https://github.com/jeffschwartz/preamble)
 is still available but is now deprecated in favor of Preamble-TS. A document describing the migration path from Preamble to Preamble-TS is in the works and will be posted here once completed.
